# Carnival

`Carnival` aims to create a single website to showcase neat games made by the community. Games span across many genres - some even have multiplayer support!

The project is in early development. If you have a suggestion, feel free to [add one](https://github.com/repl-it-discord/carnival/issues/2). This project also has a channel on the [repl.it discord server](https://repl.it/discord) if you wish to chat real time!
